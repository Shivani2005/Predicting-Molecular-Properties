# Predicting-Molecular-Properties
In a molecule, there are predominantly two tpes of magnetic coupling involved. The first one is called the dipole-dipole interaction which is caused by the polarization caused by the neighboring atoms' electrons and the second type is the J coupling which is caused by purturbations caused on a nucleus due the spin of the neighboring nuclei.
The aim of this project is to predict the value of scalar coupling constant also called J-coupling constant. 
Logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting with a learning rate of 0.5 is used to train the model.
